## 1) JSFE lang | a small role playing game

The objective of the exercise is to investigate how variables, JS contol structures and objects can be used to dynamically change the content of a page. In addition, you will also get the chance to use some of Window Consoles functions, often used to debug and handle errors in the code.

## 2) JSFE dom | handling dom-elements

The objective of the exercise is to use DOM to reach and manipulate content, and to investigate how JS contol structures can be used to dynamically change the content of a page.

## 3) JSFE dom | change dom-content dynamically

The objective of the exercise is to further investigate how JS contol structures can be used to dynamically change the content of a page.

## 4) JSFE api | download, show and send data from/to the server

The purpose with the exercise is to understand JSON, fetch data from a server and show it on a webpage, and use the posibility to send data.

## 5) JSFE pro | course submission

The objective of the submission is, from an optional open api, to create a foundation for a dynamically controlled web page; similar to a web shop. The application should display "products" in a gallery, taken from at selected api.
